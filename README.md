# Android Developer Nanodegreee Project #2 - Popular Movies - Stage 1

## Project Overview
In this project I created an app which shows information about popular movies or top rated movies from themoviedb.org.
It was my second Android Developer project and it's goal was to become more skilled with API requests, UI design, ..

## API Setup instructions
Rename the ApiKey.java.sample (located in the preferences src dir) to ApiKey.java and insert your API key

## App feature overview
- OptionMenu, which allows you to switch between two overviews:
  - Popular Movies
  - Top Rated Movies
- Provide you more insights on the movie, like release year, description, ...

## Lessons learned from this project
- There are so many cool libraries out there, which make life easy
  - GSON is awesome
  - Picasso also helps a lot
- In future I should maybe also work in early stages with branches. Some commits contained way too much different stuff (for example while implementing async API requests)
- It's a good practice to lint the code
